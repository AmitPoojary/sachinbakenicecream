            <p>The town of Uppinangady saw Sundara Gowda start his journey in an ice cream parlor, 
               run by Ganappana Shetty. Well versed with not just the production of ice creams, 
               Sundara Gowda also spent time understanding the business behind running the parlor. 
               This helped him set up his own in the year 1992. With Savitha, his wife, being the wind 
               beneath his wings, and Ganappana Shetty standing tall as a support pillar, 
               Sundara Gowda set up Sachin Sweets Juice and Cream parlor in the heart of Uppinangadi town. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Sachin Sweet Juice and Cream had a humble beginning with Sundara Gowda and Savita starting out with one small ice cream making machine, producing a days worth produce. Savita, on the other hand would manage to mix and produce lip smacking namkeens and sweets at home. The place is still very well known for ice creams, namkeen products, and sweet items.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Sundara Gowda had learnt the art of running a successful business in the food industry and in the year 2000, he helped his nephew Poovappa Gowda start his bakery business. Over the years, Povappa and Rama, his wife, have grown this business multi fold and the place is well known for the quality and taste of its products.

            </p>
            <p>
                    Having spent his initial years in his fathers bakery and ice cream parlor, Sachin, Son of Sundara Gowda and Savita, has always had a penchant for ice cream and bakery business. He spent his formative years behind the cash counter learning about family business and customer relationship skills. Schooled in Indraprastha Vidyalaya, Uppinangadi, Sachin has also completed his Bachelors in Business Management from SDM College of Business Management, Mangalore. He had decided early on to not take a 9-5 job but instead to hone his skills in expanding the bakery business. Sachin took a plunge into this entrepreneurial world, in 2012, to start FLAVORS, an ice creams brand, while pursuing his Masters in Business Management from Sikkim Manipal University (correspondence course).  Flavors has been producing  varieties of ice cream products like family pack ice creams, candies, ice cream sticks, chocobar, dolly etc. With standardized quality and new technology machines, Flavors has a production capacity of approx 40 litres of ice creams/day of 15 flavors and 70 products are up for sale on a daily basis. This is a feather on his cap.
            </p>
            <p>
                    With a vision to grow and expand his business, Sachin started a 6 weeks long certification course from Lavonne Academy of Baking Science and Pastry Arts in the year 2017. With extensive training in the production of breads, hard breads, chocolates, puffs, pastries, sponge cakes etc, Sachin started experimenting on new products with different and unique flavors. Travelling across India and meeting renowned ice cream and pastry chefs helped him in his innovations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Sachin has expanded his business to meet growing customer demands and now runs Sachin Bakes & Creams. The family business â€“ Sachin Sweets Juice and Cream parlor continues to delight its customer base, operating out of its old shop.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Savitaaz is another brain child of Sachin that will concentrate in bringing to customers the taste of bakery products, namkeens, and sweets. Flavors will continue to innovate and bring new products to delight its customers.
